## 6. Interpretation

### Interpretation Principles

This code is interpreted under the following principles:

**Minimalism:**

- Only regulates what is essential for project integrity

**Precision:**

- No ambiguity in prohibitions

**Determinism:**

- Violations are objectively identifiable

**Non-negotiability:**

- Standards are not subject to debate

---

## Status

This Code of Conduct is **minimalist by design**.

```
Participation in AHI Governance Labs projects 
constitutes acceptance of this policy.
```

### Non-Applicability of External Standards

This code **does not adopt** external conduct frameworks such as:

- Contributor Covenant
- Other community codes of conduct
- Diversity and inclusion standards unrelated to technical competence

The reason: these frameworks introduce ambiguity and subjectivity incompatible with deterministic governance.
